## Large-scale Benchmark for Small Object Detection: SODA
**SODA** is a large-scale benckmark for Small Object Detection, including SODA-D and SODA-A which concentrate on Driving and Aerial scenarios respectively.

### Update
 - [20220726] Our [Homepage](https://shaunyuan22.github.io/SODA/) for SODA benchmark opens!
 - [20220726] The paper of SODA dataset and a thorough review on Small Object Detection is submitted to [*arXiv*](https://arxiv.org).
 - [20220726] SODA Benchmark if officially available, please refer to the Dataset Download 
 - [20220726] [Codes](https://github.com/shaunyuan22/SODA) for training and evaluating of SODA-D and SODA-A dataset are released.
 - [20220726] Pretrained models for SODA-D and SODA-A are released, please refer to the Dataset Download 
 
### SODA-D
SODA-D contains 24704 well-chosen and high-quality images under driving scenarios, on which 274496 instances of 9 categories with horizontal bounding boxes were annotated. Some example images are shown below.

### SODA-A
SODA-A comprises 2510 high-resolution images ofaerial scenes, which has 780203 instances annotated with oriented rectangle box annotations over 9 classes. An example image of SODA-A is shown next.
